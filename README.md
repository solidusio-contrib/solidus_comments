Solidus Comments
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/solidusio-contrib/solidus_comments.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/solidusio-contrib/solidus_comments)

Solidus Comments is an extension for Solidus to allow commenting on different models via the
admin ui and currently supports Orders & Shipments.

Solidus Comments also supports optional comment Types which can be defined per comment-able
object (i.e. Order, Shipment, etc) via the admin Configuration tab.

This is based on a fork / rename of jderrett/spree-order-comments, and subsequently spree/spree-comments

Notes:

* Comments are create-only.  You cannot edit or remove them from the Admin UI.
